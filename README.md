# IP-THAT-IN-OSINT
A.OSINT CHALLENGES 




B. Title of Proposal:
 IP That in OSINT

C. Problem Statement:
1. IP Address Tracker App

2.Multi-Platform Compatibility

3.Real-Time Tracking:



 The main challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I will be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Develop the IP Address Tracker app to be compatible across multiple platforms, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Ensure a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, offering a consistent experience regardless of the device used.

Implement real-time tracking capabilities in the IP Address Tracker app. Explore ways to continuously update the map and information as new IP addresses are tracked. Consider optimizing API calls and map updates for efficiency and responsiveness.



D. Proposed Solution:

I)USE CASE DIAGRAM








II)TECHSTACKS-
A)Semantic HTML5 markup
B)CSS CUSTOM PROPERTIES
C)FLEX
D)FREE IP GEO LOCATION
E)LEAFLET (MAP JS API)
F)CLOUD FIRESTORE

III)OPTIONS -

THE IP ADRESS TRACKER

A)IP ADDRESS
B)LOCATION
C)TIME ZONE(IN Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) format )
D)ISP (Internet service provider)



IV) The main usp of the project to use this web app in the OSINT Challenges in Capture The Flag (CTF) Competion.

E. Results/Expected outcomes:
The expected result from this website is  to use in the web pentesting for the IP ADDRESSES search and in OSINT CHALLENGES IN CTF competition very smoothly.

F. Risk and Mitigation plan:
For some reason the limit of 1000 requests has ended very fast. Possible my API key isn't hidden well enough, I am not sure and didn't test it much. The limit doesn't seem to be available once it's used up and this project is not worth any financial investment right now. I changed to another API and hoping that it will work however it does lack some information like ISP, for example. For now I decided to leave this way. The new API I used is provided down below. For some reason the gitignore is havin'g issues so I decided to keep the API key visible on purpose.


I. Business Plan:-
No business plan for the website . Use this web app for testing purposes in web penetration testing

J. Conclusion and Future Work:-
For future purposes I have a plan in integrate all Dos attacks visible in this IP ADDRESS TRACKER WEB APP “IP THAT in OSINT”.


K. About the project :-
In this challenge, I will be using two separate APIs together to create an IP Address Tracking app. The main challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I will be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

1.View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
3.See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load.
4.Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.
